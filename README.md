## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in investigating body composition changes of Olympic
athletes over time. For this purpose, I analyzed a data set of 120 years of olympic
athletes. Mainly, I was interested in the following questions:

1. How did athletesâ€™ physique change over time in team sports?
2. Do you even lift? Did athletes become stronger over time?
3. Can we say something about medalists?

## File Description
The analysis is contained in a single notebook olympics.ipynb. The data set is also provided in /data but is taken from Kaggle (see below).

## Results
My findings are presented in a blogpost on [Medium](https://medium.com/@lars.palzer/when-bigger-is-really-better-1628c128407a)
