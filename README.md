## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in investigating body composition changes of Olympic
athletes over time. For this purpose, I analyzed a data set of 120 years of olympic
athletes. Mainly, I was interested in the following questions:

1. How did athletesâ€™ physique change over time in team sports?
2. Do you even lift? Did athletes become stronger over time?
3. Can we say something about medalists?


## File Description
The analysis is contained in a single notebook olympics.ipynb. The data set is also provided in /data but is taken from Kaggle (see below).

## Libraries and Dependencies
The notebook uses the following Python libraries:
* numpy 
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## Results
My findings are presented in a blogpost on [Medium](https://medium.com/@lars.palzer/when-bigger-is-really-better-1628c128407a).

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements
The analysis is based on the "120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results" data set taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).
Feel free to use my notebook as you wish!
